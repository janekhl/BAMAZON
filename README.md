bamazonCustomer.js is an app that allows a customer to see what is being sold on BAMazon and buy however much they want of that item as long as that quantity is available. 
To use, in the terminal type "node bamazonCustomer.js" and a list of products that are available for sale will appear.  
A few seconds later, options to buy a product of your choosing in whatever quantity you wish (within reason, depending on availability) will appear.

bamazonManager.js is an app that allows the user to take the role of manager on BAMazon
Typing "node bamazonManager.js" will allow you to view and edit the stock. 
You can update quantities on items already being sold, add new items, view the total stock, and view items BAMazon is running low on (items that have a quantity of less than 3).
Most things have a setTimeout of three seconds just to improve readability.
